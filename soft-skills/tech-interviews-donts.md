# Do's and don'ts of a technical interviews

All of these can throw off the recrutee, take away they're fair chance to show their best. And if they do, you may loose a valuable future employee. It will also discourage this person from ever applying again and spread the negative opinion in their environment.

* **Use camera.** Especially, when the other side uses one staying invisible creates more distance then necessary. When combined with the rectrutee using camera it can make them feel as if you're more privelaged or they're below you. Don't expect your interlocutor to turn off their camera if you don't use one, they're the ones applying, they may feel obliged to make the best possible impression, even when they feel uncomfortable.
* **Share the right answers**, there are two sides to that:
  * Meeting all the answers with silence / scribbling creates nervous atmosphere, by making them unsure, their mind lingering on the last question they might have failed.
  * It strips this meeting of value to the recrutee, they could have learned something, maybe shared they're perspective, shown they know something they didn't connect to the question asked.
* **Don't overextend the interview's time**, if it was scheduled for 45 minutes the content / amount of questions should be possible to answer in 45 minutes. You may meet someone talkative and hurrying them a bit is fine, but you have to meet the time limitation first.
* **Don't start the interview for highlighting you're in a hurry**. Especially, if you proceed with questions that are impossible to answer in the scheduled time. 
* **Avoid questions about practices that are considered harmful** if you don't specifically ask for bad practices.
* **Don't eat if you don't have to**, if it's necessary - excuse yourself, your interlocutor will understand and won't feel disrespected.
